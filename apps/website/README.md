# AirGradient Map Frontend

This is the frontend application for AirGradient Map, built with and Nuxt.js.

## Development Setup

For the complete monorepo setup and Docker configuration, please refer to the [root README.md](../../README.md).

### Frontend-Specific Development

#### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

The frontend is included in the main Docker Compose setup. From the root directory:

```bash
docker compose --env-file apps/api/.env.development -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Option 2: Direct Node.js Setup

If you prefer to run only the frontend locally:

Prerequisites:

- Node.js v22 or higher

1. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Start the development server**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

**Note:** When running frontend-only, you'll need to ensure the API is running separately or configure the frontend to point to a running API instance.

## Mobile Development

For mobile development (iOS), use the following commands:

```bash
# iOS
npm run add:ios
npm run build:dev:ios
```

**Note:** Mobile development requires direct Node.js setup and cannot be run through Docker. Currently, mobile development is in the early stages and is not fully ready for production use.

## Frontend Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server without Docker
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# Format code
npm run format

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Frontend Troubleshooting

Common frontend-specific issues:

1. **Port already in use**:

```bash
# Check what's using port 3000
lsof -i :3000
# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
```

2. **Node modules issues**:

```bash
# Remove node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

3. **Build cache issues**:

```bash
# Clear Nuxt cache
rm -rf .nuxt
rm -rf .output
npm run dev
```
